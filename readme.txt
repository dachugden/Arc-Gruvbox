Arc-Gruvbox is a GTK theme based on Arc https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme and using the Gruvbox color scheme https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox.

This is a WIP. Testers for the various DE/WMs would be appreciated. Most GTK2 and GTK3 applications seem to work well, but only tested in XFCE with XFWM. Unity, Gnome-shell, and Cinnamon files were adapted but not tested.
